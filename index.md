This is the website for the D.A.N.C.E. (Derived and Non-Commutative Enthusiasts) seminar.
It is an online seminar aimed at young researchers, e.g. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, interested in triangulated categories arising in noncommutative algebraic geometry (quite roughly interpreted).
The seminar is a biweekly event with ~50 minute talks and ~10 minutes for questions, see the schedule [here](https://danceseminar.github.io/schedule).
Unless otherwise specified, we run the seminar on DATE/TIME through MEDIUM.
Please contact EMAIL to register for the seminar.
