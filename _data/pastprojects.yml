- {name: 'Software Engineering at Project Jupyter',
  description: "I worked for over two years as a software engineering intern for <a href='https://jupyter.org/'>Project Jupyter</a>, 
  with a focus on JupyterLab, a web-based framework for interactive computing.
  Led by Dr. Brian Granger and Dr. Zach Sailer, I built two JupyterLab plugins that are now dependencies for multiple other projects, 
  and developed methods for adding custom front ends to the Jupyter server.
  Along the way, I collaborated closely with other developers and UI/UX designers to conduct user testing
  and make design decisions. Cumulatively, my projects in JupyterLab development place me in the 
  tool’s top 20 contributors of all time—work that both expanded existing computational software and 
  enabled a range of scientific programming across disciplines.",

- {name: 'Human Trafficking Detection with the Global Emancipation Network',
  description: "I led a team with two other students, in collaboration with the <a href='https://www.globalemancipation.ngo/'>
  Global Emancipation Network</a>,
   to identify California businesses
   engaging in human trafficking. We scraped web data on illicit 
   massage parlors and developed a novel model to predict their involvement in human trafficking. In April 2020,
    the model’s output was presented to the FBI, directly resulting in the investigation and subsequent
    raiding of multiple California human trafficking hubs. We also performed a case study regarding
    these parlors in San Luis Obispo County, culminating in a June 2020 report for the district attorney. 
    This work set a precedent for similar endeavors in other states, including in Texas, Washington, and 
    Michigan, thus enhancing our machine learning toolkit for the fight against human trafficking.",

- {name: 'Understanding Co-Curricular Participation of Engineering Students',
  description: "My undergraduate research included working with Dr. Chance Hoellwarth on an NSF-funded
   study on minority students in engineering. As a research assistant, I analyzed survey data, working to
  understand the factors that influence these students' participation in co-curricular activities. 
  This work culminated in a proposal of action to increase diversity in these activities for Cal
   Poly’s College of Engineering, and an expanded study involving several other universities worldwide.",
