  description: "In collaboration with cognitive scientists, I am exploring the use of latent variable models to understand and facilitate interactions between humans
  and AI agents. This includes my recent work on a Bayesian framework for capturing and characterizing humans' mental models of AI. Additionally, I am currently
  developing algorithms for human-AI delegation, leveraging the unique strengths and weaknesses of individual humans and
  AI agents.",

      Dr. Vladimir Minin, I help maintain a dashboard that displays up-to-date information on COVID tests, cases, hospitalizations,
      and deaths in California, with a focus on Orange County. This dashboard combines data from several
      sources and aims to present it to California residents in an understandable manner.",
