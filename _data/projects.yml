  description: "In collaboration with cognitive scientists, I am exploring the use of latent variable models to understand and facilitate interactions between humans
  and AI agents. This includes my recent work on a Bayesian framework for capturing and characterizing humans' mental models of AI. Additionally, I am currently
  developing algorithms for human-AI delegation, leveraging the unique strengths and weaknesses of individual humans and
  AI agents.",

      headed by Dr. Sameer Singh, Dr. Padhraic Smyth, and Dr. Philip Papadopoulos.
      In particular, I am developing automatically-generated performance baselines for the repository's 
      datasets. I also contribute to general design and functionality decisions, and serve as a repository curator and librarian,
      curating and maintaining our datasets and their metadata.",
